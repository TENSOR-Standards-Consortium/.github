## Mission

Unify the security community around an open, vendor-neutral, graph-first framework and standard where collaboration is built in, extensions thrive, and collective resilience becomes the norm.

---

## About the TENSOR Framework

The TENSOR Framework defines a **single, authoritative threat‑response graph**—a common vocabulary of nodes and edges that captures how security events relate across people, systems, and data. Domain‑ or vendor‑specific extensions layer **on top** of this core without altering it, eliminating repetitive playbook rewrites and letting teams share context instantly while avoiding vendor lock‑in.

**Core coverage:** The graph spans seven foundational domains—Application, Cloud, Email, File, Host, Identity, and Network—providing end‑to‑end visibility without perimeter bias.

**Draft status:** The framework and consortium are still evolving, and details are subject to change. Join the discussion in GitHub to help shape the first stable release.

## What we do

* **Publish standards** | We maintain the **TENSOR Framework** core specification and extension guidelines.
* **Foster collaboration** | We bring together practitioners, vendors, and researchers to iterate in the open.
* **Ecosystem enablement** | Reference tools, schemas, and sample decision graphs lower the barrier to adoption.
* **Advocate globally** | We partner with industry bodies and academia to drive harmonisation, reduce duplication, and elevate defensive capabilities worldwide.
